# About Me:
<br>I’m an Electronics Engineering student who likes building things and figuring out how they actually work under the hood.<br><br>I started out playing around with Arduino, but lately I’ve been getting into STM32 and proper embedded C. I enjoy working closer to the hardware — dealing with registers, interrupts, and communication protocols instead of just using libraries.<br><br>I’ve also spent some time working on drone projects, which got me really interested in how hardware, firmware, and communication systems all fit together.<br><br>Right now I’m focused on getting my fundamentals strong — C, Microcontrollers, and core electronics — so I can build more solid systems in the future.<br><br>Trying to get better at electronics and chess<br>
